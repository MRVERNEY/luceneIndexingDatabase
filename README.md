# luceneIndexingDatabase

##Index Based on Lucene
---
the purpose of this project is to construct a inverted index for a Knowledge Graph containing all triples grasped from wikipedia, baidubaike and hudongbaike.

To get an intuition of how the triple organized, you can visit [zhishi.me](http://zhishi.me/)

After indexing, the resources is much like a searching engine through which you can access subjects if its virtual document contains certain words.

To know how we construct the virtual document for each subject, you can visit [instance matching](https://github.com/MRVERNEY/InstanceMatching)
